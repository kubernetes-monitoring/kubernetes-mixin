            This issue has not had any activity in the past 30 days, so the
            `stale` label has been added to it.

            * The `stale` label will be removed if there is new activity
            * The issue will be closed in 7 days if there is no new activity
            * Add the `keepalive` label to exempt this issue from the stale check action

            Thank you for your contributions!
          stale-pr-message: |
            This PR has been automatically marked as stale because it has not
            had any activity in the past 30 days.

            The next time this stale check runs, the stale label will be
            removed if there is new activity. The issue will be closed in 7
            days if there is no new activity.

            Thank you for your contributions!
